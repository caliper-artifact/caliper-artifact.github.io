# CALIPER Artifact

This repository contains the anonymous artifact release for CALIPER, a prompt-robustness dataset and benchmark built from Alpaca, GSM8K, and MMLU prompts. It includes the canonical CALIPER dataset files, along with code, metadata, samples, manual audit files, analysis outputs, paper figures, and Croissant/Responsible AI metadata.

## Main Files

- `caliper_croissant_rai.json`: Croissant and Responsible AI metadata.
- `asset_licenses.md`: license and version manifest for source datasets, evaluated models, and generated artifacts.
- `prompts_paraphrases/`: canonical prompt/paraphrase files.
- `paraphrase_answers/`: model generations for Alpaca, GSM8K, and MMLU.
- `metric_scores/`: response-quality metric score files for the evaluated model generations.
- `samples/`: sample files from the canonical release for quick inspection.
- `manual_audit/manual_audit_results.md`: manual audit summary.
- `code/`: scripts used for preprocessing, generation, scoring, analysis, and the browser-based explorer.
- `code.zip`: zipped copy of the submitted code tree.

## Scoring Provenance

All reported automated content-preservation and task-performance scores used `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` as the judge model. Scoring was run in September 2025 with deterministic decoding, temperature 0, and fixed system instructions.

## Manual Audit

The manual audit sample contains 1,000 reviewed examples. The current audit summary reports content-preservation agreement 0.9161 with Cohen's kappa 0.8133 over 298 examples with judge CP present, and task agreement 0.9240 with Cohen's kappa 0.8480 over 1,000 reviewed examples.

To recompute the audit agreement from this repository:

```bash
python manual_audit/compute_manual_audit_agreement.py
```

## Code

The code is grouped by role:

- `code/preprocessing/`: source dataset conversion and paraphrase generation.
- `code/inference_scoring/`: model inference, Gemini scoring, and result-merging utilities.
- `code/analysis/`: scripts for aggregation, tables, figures, and score checks.
- `code/explorer/`: static browser interface for exploring CALIPER scores.

The Python scripts were syntax-checked after staging. Rust manifests are included for the Rust utilities; reviewers using Rust 1.88 or newer should be able to resolve the current crate ecosystem directly, while the included manifests pin `time` for compatibility with Rust 1.87.

## Terms

This is a mixed-license artifact. CALIPER-authored code, metadata, and documentation use Apache-2.0. Redistributed or prompt-derived records preserve the upstream source dataset licenses and evaluated model-provider terms. See `asset_licenses.md` for exact license and version strings.
